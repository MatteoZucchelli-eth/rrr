# ü¶æ 3-DOF Planar Robotic Arm Control ‚Äì Humanoid Challenge

This repository contains a ROS 2-based simulation of a simple 3-DOF planar robotic arm. The main goal is to control the end-effector to track a moving target in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

To get the code up and running:

1. Clone this repository into your ROS 2 workspace (e.g., `~/ros2_ws/src/`).
2. Activate the virtual environment
   
   ```bash
   
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   ```
   
4. Build the workspace:

   ```bash
   
   colcon build --packages-select rrr_challenge
   source install/setup.bash
   
   ```
   
5. Launch the system with:

   ```bash

   ros2 launch rrr_challenge display.launch.py

   ```

## ü§ñ Robot Modeling
To model the robot:

1. The simplified robotic arm was designed using Onshape.
2. The STL files were exported and used to construct a URDF model.
3. The robot model is visualized using RViz for simulation and debugging.

## üß† Node Architecture
The system consists of four ROS 2 nodes, all written in Python:

### 1. **Master Node**
- **Publishes**: `/desired_pose`
- **Description**: Periodically generates and publishes a target position that the robot's end-effector must follow.

---

### 2. **End-Effector Node**
- **Publishes**: `/end_effector_pose`
- **Description**: Computes the current Cartesian coordinates of the end-effector from the joint states visualized in RViz and publishes a clean, ready-to-use version.

---

### 3. **Simulation Node**
- **Subscribes**: `/joint_states_vel`
- **Publishes**: `/joint_states`
- **Description**: Simulates the robot by updating joint angles based on commanded velocities using:


    $$\theta_{new} = \theta_{old} +  \dot{\theta} \cdot Œît$$

    where $\theta$ represents joint angles, $\dot{\theta}$ represents joint velocities, and $Œît$ is the simulation time step.

The updated joint states are published and visualized in RViz.
### 4. **Controller Node**
- **Subscribes**:
  - `/desired_pose`
  - `/end_effector_pose`
  - `/joint_states`
- **Publishes**:  `/joint_states_vel`
- **Description**: Controls the robot by computing the joint velocities required to make the end-effector follow the target trajectory.

### üß© How It Works:

The controller reads both the current and desired end-effector positions.

From robotics kinematics:

$$\dot{x} = J(\theta) \cdot \dot{\theta}$$

where:

- $\dot{x}$: velocity of the end-effector  
- $J(\theta)$: Jacobian matrix  
- $\dot{\theta}$: joint velocities  

To compute the required joint velocities:

$$\dot{\theta} = J^+(\theta) \cdot \dot{x}$$

where $J^+$ is the **damped pseudo-inverse** of the Jacobian.

   ```python

   J_inv = J.T @ np.linalg.inv(J @ J.T + self.lambda_damping**2 * I)

   ```


Instead of calculating the desired end-effector velocity $\dot{x}$ analytically, it is approximated using a **Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller**:

$$
\dot{x} \approx K_p \cdot (x_d - x_c) + K_d \cdot (-\dot{x}_c)
$$

where:
- $x_d$: desired end-effector position  
- $x_c$: current end-effector position  
- $\dot{x}_c$: current end-effector velocity  
- $K_p$: proportional gain  
- $K_d$: derivative gain

### Constrained Solution:

To see the constrained solution, change branch to `constrained_solution`:

```

git checkout constrained_solution

```

To successfully solve the constrained problem, I used a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver that respects joint limits and ensures smooth tracking of the desired trajectory.

The system is able to follow a sinusoidal trajectory with frequency f = 1 Hz, running on a controller operating at f = 100 Hz.
